Using a \acl{CAP} which was tuned specifically to reproduce eigenenergies
obtained in a single-particle picture using a complex self-energy, we are able
to model the effect of coupling of a quantum device to leads within a \ac{CI}
(many-body) formalism. For two different degrees of device-lead coupling, the
effect of electron correlation on the shifts and broadenings of quasiparticle
levels is studied by decreasing the threshold for inclusion of
Configuration State Functions into the \ac{CI} vector.
