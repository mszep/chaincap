Using a \acl{CAP} which was tuned specifically to reproduce eigenenergies
obtained in a single-particle picture using a complex self-energy, we are able
to model the effect of coupling of a quantum device to leads within a
Configuration Interaction (many-body) formalism. The device and leads consist
of chains of Au atoms, with a constant and identical interatomic spacing. Two
values of device-lead spacing are studied, corresponding to different degrees
of coupling. For both degrees of coupling, the effect of electron correlation
on the shifts and broadenings of quasiparticle levels is studied by gradually
decreasing the threshold for inclusion of Configuration State Functions into
the CI vector.
