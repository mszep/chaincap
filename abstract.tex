As electronics devices scale to sub--10 nanometer lengths, the distinction
between `device' and `electrodes' becomes blurred.
Here, we study a simple model of a molecular tunnel junction, consisting
of an atomic gold chain partitioned into left and right electrodes, and a
central `molecule'.
Using a complex absorbing potential, we are able to reproduce the
single-particle energy levels of the device region including a description
of the effects of the ``semi-infinite'' electrodes.
We then use the method of configuration interaction to explore the effect
of correlations on the system's quasiparticle peaks.
We find that when excitations on the leads are not included, the device's
\ac{HOMO} and \ac{LUMO} quasiparticle peaks when including correlation
are bracketed by their respective values in the Hartree-Fock (Koopmans)
and \dscf approximations.
In contrast, including excitations on the leads has significant effects
on the transmission (and hence the conductivity) of the device. The
bracketing property no longer holds and both the positions and the lifetimes
of the quasiparticle levels shift considerably, indicating that the
combined effect of coupling and correlation is to alter the quasiparticle
spectrum significantly from that of an isolated molecule.
