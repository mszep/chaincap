\section{Many-Body Analysis}

We start our analysis by considering the more weakly coupled system (45
nm separation). The transmission curves obtained for different levels of
theory are plotted in figure (whatever). Firstly, we can represent the
wave function as a single determinant. Since the only difference between
this and the single particle case described above is the basis, it is not
surprising to see good agreement, especially in the position of the peak.
Next, we can approximate the wave function by taking the same reference
determinant as above, and also including all of its single excitations.
We can expect that the results from this are analogous to a delta-SCF
procedure, since by Thouless' theorem this can be described as a single
determinant in a different basis. Finally, we can include more correlations
by running the mcci procedure, firstly at cmin=3e-3, and then at cmin=1e-3,
which generally corresponds to moderate correlation. As expected from
chemical intuition, CI singles gives the smallest gap and single
determinants the largest, with the correlated peaks in the middle and the
gap closing with increasing correlation.
